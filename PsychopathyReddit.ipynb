      "14  There is psychopath and sociopath: so im gonna try and splice it for you. A psychopath has the basic same trates as a sociopath but a psychopath can have thoughts about harming/killing things and will feel nothing and maybe even pleasure when harming / killing. And then there is a scale between the two. Personally im half and half because i have the same traits as you but i sometimes have murderous thoughts and enjoy making someone who wronged me psychologically suffer or physically if im angry and get the chance.So i would say you are a sociopath.

      "18  Creating a society instead of indiscriminate killing is just another way of surviving. It's actually very common in nature, think about wolf packs, or better, the complex hives of insects like bees and ants. We just developed our psyche in order to sustain better our population growth, the majority liked it that way, the people started developing complex thoughts like marriage and love and art. Then came the kings who decided honour, pride and family were things worth sending their people to die in war, and oh so many believed in that. I guess what you call \"madness\" can walk the circle all the way around until it gets back to the starting point.\\n\\nOf course that's an oversemplification of how human society developed, but it really seems to me that calling anything that strays from strict biological needs (except killing, which is just one of the means we have to obtain food to satisfy a biological need, e.g. hunger) is an equally simplistic and arbitrary way to put things in perspective. What you are describing can probably be better explained with the concept of \"rationality\". But a human who kills another human to get pleasure or vengeance is rational nontheless.\n",

      "21  I display ASPD behaviour that aligns with being a \"psychopath\" (we're still figuring the diagnosis so take my experience w a grain of salt) Drugs generally calm me down, mdma slows down my thought process and i do feel more emotional (I talk about things i usually don't) , I wouldn't really call it empathy since emotions and empathy are different things, but it does feel good to be on mdma. And the afterglow it's really energizing. Also it makes me less aware of my surroundings and it's like having a really good time with myself, kinda makes you feel like you are all that you need in the world. Somebody in the comments mentioned something about a demigod complex so maybe that's related to it lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
      "22  I personally think our \"need\" to reproduce it's what fucked us up. I mean, most things, if not all things, human do are related to sex, getting sex, or getting a loving partner (also related to sex) A lot of psychologists consider psychological issues as psychosexual, like \"just psychological\" doesn't exist, everything it's psychosexual. Including things like eating disorders. \\n\\nAnd so much of our behaviour it's  conditioned by sex or our relationship w sex (which most people have fucked up) even children have issues related to sex and they aren't \"sexual beings\" yet. Our DNA wants to reproduce so bad that it doesn't care if we don't function \"properly\" as a person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "33  True, but the thing is bipolar disorder mostly affects mood. In BPD, there are many other symptoms which are severly problematic and although bipolar people also experience lack of empathy Imo It's more prominent in BPD. I'm just personally getting that vibe, especially considering they posted in this subreddit, and borderline is a cluster B disorder. They probably knew here they won't be judged for the traits we share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
